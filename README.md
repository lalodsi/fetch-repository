# Dogs search

Hello! This is "dogs search" a web app created to get your new friend. You can search through out a frienly dogs in order to select your favourite and this app will match one of them for you.

You can search dogs by breed and age, and your search can include multiple breeds. I hope you like it.

This project was created using the next technologies
- React
- Typescript

But this stack can grow. For example I can add the next technologies

- Bootstrap: Could be added in order to add styles faster, but I decided to make it without this library to create all CSS styles on my own.
- Redux: I can add redux to this project in order to maintain his state and make my project scalable. It also will make this project easily debuggable.
- Storybook: It could be helpful for build the UI components and containers and test them.
